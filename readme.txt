Project: K-POP Label Comparator

    Author: Gabriele Sbrolli aka "gabeshadow"

    User task:  as a user related to a label, he pretends to visualize
                an appropriate comparison of his own label with another,
                and to realize his presence in the K-POP musical context.

    Scope:  Comparator of at most 3 labels managing artists and groups
            playing kpop music using a "RadarChart" and a table showing
            the nominal values of the calculated attributes for each label
            (ex. Quantity of male and female artists, soloists, groups and
            collaborations with other labels).

    How to use: select the labels from the lists;
                a RadarChart will represent the quality of the selected labels
                and also the nominal values are shown in a table.

    Files needed:   2 CSV:
                    one that contains all the information about individual artists
                    (typed as 'male', 'female' or 'person'), groups (typed as 'group')
                    and labels (typed as 'label'), and for each of them an 'id' and
                    the name of the artist, group or label;
                    another one that contains all possible management or membership
                    relationships between entities according to 'id' - 'id'.
